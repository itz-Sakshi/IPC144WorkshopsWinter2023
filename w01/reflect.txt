1. Yes, I do have a little bit prior experience of programming in C language. 
   Infact, I have done an introductory online course in computer programming from a platform called "edx"
   which enabled me to strengthen my foundation in C language.

2.According to my understanding of the compilation process of converting a C text file into an executable program,
  I beleive it involves a total number of four steps.
  Firstly, the preprocessing takes place in which the header files are resolved and comments are removed from the initial text file. 
  Afterwards, the real compiling takes place and the contents of file are converted into assembly level instructions and
  then further converted into machine level instructions. 
  Lastly, the linking is done in which the final executable file is created.

3. By doing this course, I would like to get more familiar with C language and broaden my understanding 
   of computer programming. Ultimately by the end of this course, I would have learnt how to think critically and 
   algorithmically and will begin to solve programming problems more efficiently.
